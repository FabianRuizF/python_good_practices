# python_good_practices
A simple repository for python good practices

1.- Everything should be in english (documentation, comments, diagrams, etc)
2.- The formal way to declare a variable is name_of_variable
3.- The formal way to declare a class is NameOfClass (known as CamelCase or  StudlyCaps)
4.- No spanglish at all.
5.- If regex is needed for anything, it should be asked previously to the team.
6.- Password can't be pushed to github, unless is known that we can rotate them easily.
7.- No push to main, there should be different branch for different people wokring on a project.
8.- Don't name your files "create_file_v1","create_file_v2". Git should be used for versioning, not the names.
9.- A function should usually do one thing.
